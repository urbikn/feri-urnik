  # This variable specifies where to save the geckodriver used
  # for creating and running the browser.
  # This is only needed when the program can't find the geckodriver in any of the $PATH's maps.
  # The location tells the program where to save the downloaded geckodriver.
  # You can change the location to somewhere else, but it has to be
  # included in the $PATH!
